                    <p><strong>The film is a black comedy about a fledgling serial killer that falls in love with a suicidal girl who, unbeknown to him, is only hanging around because she wants him to make her his next victim.</strong></p>

                    <p>The film opens with serial killer Edward and his growing taste for murder; after struggling to suppress his darkening desires he stumbles upon Vivian, a young woman who has given up on life and wants nothing more than to kill herself - the problem is, she just can't seem to get it right. Although this seems like a match made in heaven, things quickly get complicated when Edward realizes he’s falling in love...</p>

                    <p>This black comedy-cum-psychological thriller is bursting with originality and style. Directed by first-time feature director Max Sobol, this is an exciting and surprising debut produced on a micro budget. Frustrated with the barriers to funding for  young film-makers, Max worked tirelessly with a team of committed collaborators to create this film and showcase their undoubtable talents. Despite the long breaks needed to raise more funds (the whole crew had full time jobs to work around), the difficulties of maintaining motivation over 3 years and Max’s constant battle with punctuality, this small but passionate team have given everything to get this film finished with remarkable results.</p>

                    <p>With outstanding performances from leads Hannah Kew and Chris Wilde, the film will premiere at the East End Film festival on Tuesday 17th June. Following this, the team are planning a self-distribution strategy, taking the film on the road and touring the independent cinemas of the country, drumming up interest that will hopefully allow Max to fulfill his dream - to make another film!</p>

                    <p>This film is a lesson in taking your career into your own hands and is a must-see for anyone interested in supporting and promoting genuine grass roots talent in British Film. Your support means we can go on to make more truly independent British films - show your support by liking and sharing the links on this site and hopefully we will be coming to a cinema near you soon! Get involved.</p>

                    <p><strong>Benjamin Hudson and Paul Bowyer</strong> <br />Better known for their work as hip-hop production duo <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com/baconhead/" target="_blank">Baconhead</a>, You(us)Me is Hudson and Bowyer's first foray into feature-length film. To lead us through the film's troubled romance, the pair have blended brooding synth tones, foley sound, viola and double bass. The result is emotionally unsettling score that moves from the warm and hypnotic to the jarring and powerful.</p>
